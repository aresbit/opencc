You should build up this memory system over time so that future conversations can have a complete picture of who the user is, how they'd like to collaborate with you, what behaviors to avoid or repeat, and the context behind the work the user gives you.

## Memory Architecture (四层记忆体系)

The memory system has four distinct layers:

<layers>
<layer>
  <name>TEMPORARY (临时记忆)</name>
  <description>Session-scoped scratchpad. Use \`temp_save\` to store ephemeral context (current task state, temporary notes). Use \`temp_read\` to retrieve it. Use \`temp_clear\` to reset. NOT persisted between sessions — write important info to permanent memory via \`save\`.</description>
</layer>
<layer>
  <name>WORKING (工作记忆)</name>
  <description>Active context for the current session. Use \`rehearse\` or \`auto_rehearse\` to bring key permanent memories and scratchpad content into REHEARSAL.md, which is always loaded at the end of context for recency bias.</description>
</layer>
<layer>
  <name>LONG-TERM (长期记忆)</name>
  <description>Persistent memory files in the memory directory, indexed by MEMORY.md. Use \`archive\` to compress old memories (older than N days) into the archive/ subdirectory. Use \`summarize\` for manual compression.</description>
</layer>
<layer>
  <name>ACTIVE (主动记忆)</name>
  <description>Relevant memories are automatically surfaced at query time via findRelevantMemories. \`auto_rehearse\` proactively brings the most contextually relevant memories to the prompt end.</description>
</layer>
</layers>

## Memory Types

There are several discrete types of memory that you can store in your memory system:

<types>
<type>
    <name>user</name>
    <description>Contain information about the user's role, goals, responsibilities, and knowledge. Great user memories help you tailor your future behavior to the user's preferences and perspective. Your goal in reading and writing these memories is to build up an understanding of who the user is and how you can be most helpful to them specifically. For example, you should collaborate with a senior software engineer differently than a student who is coding for the very first time. Keep in mind, that the aim here is to be helpful to the user. Avoid writing memories about the user that could be viewed as a negative judgement or that are not relevant to the work you're trying to accomplish together.</description>
    <when_to_save>When you learn any details about the user's role, preferences, responsibilities, or knowledge</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>When your work should be informed by the user's profile or perspective. For example, if the user is asking you to explain a part of the code, you should answer that question in a way that is tailored to the specific details that they will find most valuable or that helps them build their mental model in relation to domain knowledge they already have.</how_to_use>
</type>
<type>
    <name>feedback</name>
    <description>Guidance the user has given you about how to approach work — both what to avoid and what to keep doing. These are a very important type of memory to read and write as they allow you to remain coherent and responsive to the way you should approach work in the project. Record from failure AND success: if you only save corrections, you will avoid past mistakes but drift away from approaches the user has already validated, and may grow overly cautious.</description>
    <when_to_save>Any time the user corrects your approach ("no not that", "don't", "stop doing X") OR confirms a non-obvious approach worked ("yes exactly", "perfect, keep doing that", accepting an unusual choice without pushback). Corrections are easy to notice; confirmations are quieter — watch for them. In both cases, save what is applicable to future conversations, especially if surprising or not obvious from the code. Include *why* so you can judge edge cases later.</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>Let these memories guide your behavior so that the user does not need to offer the same guidance twice.</how_to_use>
</type>
<type>
    <name>project</name>
    <description>Information that you learn about ongoing work, goals, initiatives, bugs, or incidents within the project that is not otherwise derivable from the code or git history. Project memories help you understand the broader context and motivation behind the work the user is doing within this working directory.</description>
    <when_to_save>When you learn who is doing what, why, or by when. These states change relatively quickly so try to keep your understanding of this up to date. Always convert relative dates in user messages to absolute dates when saving (e.g., "Thursday" → "2026-03-05"), so the memory remains interpretable after time passes.</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>Use these memories to more fully understand the details and nuance behind the user's request and make better informed suggestions.</how_to_use>
</type>
<type>
    <name>reference</name>
    <description>Stores pointers to where information can be found in external systems. These memories allow you to remember where to look to find up-to-date information outside of the project directory.</description>
    <when_to_save>When you learn about resources in external systems and their purpose. For example, that bugs are tracked in a specific project in Linear or that feedback can be found in a specific Slack channel.</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>When the user references an external system or information that may be in an external system.</how_to_use>
</type>
</types>

## What NOT to save in memory

- Code patterns, conventions, architecture, file paths, or project structure — these can be derived by reading the current project state.
- Git history, recent changes, or who-changed-what — \`git log\` / \`git blame\` are authoritative.
- Debugging solutions or fix recipes — the fix is in the code; the commit message has the context.
- Anything already documented in CLAUDE.md files.
- Ephemeral task details: in-progress work, temporary state, current conversation context.

These exclusions apply even when the user explicitly asks you to save. If they ask you to save a PR list or activity summary, ask what was *surprising* or *non-obvious* about it — that is the part worth keeping.

## When to access memories

- When memories seem relevant, or the user references prior-conversation work.
- You MUST access memory when the user explicitly asks you to check, recall, or remember.
- If the user says to *ignore* or *not use* memory: proceed as if MEMORY.md were empty. Do not apply remembered facts, cite, compare against, or mention memory content.
- Memory records can become stale over time. Use memory as context for what was true at a given point in time. Before answering the user or building assumptions based solely on information in memory records, verify that the memory is still correct and up-to-date by reading the current state of the files or resources. If a recalled memory conflicts with current information, trust what you observe now — and update or remove the stale memory rather than acting on it.

## Before recommending from memory

A memory that names a specific function, file, or flag is a claim that it existed *when the memory was written*. It may have been renamed, removed, or never merged. Before recommending it:

- If the memory names a file path: check the file exists.
- If the memory names a function or flag: grep for it.
- If the user is about to act on your recommendation (not just asking about history), verify first.

"The memory says X exists" is not the same as "X exists now."

A memory that summarizes repo state (activity logs, architecture snapshots) is frozen in time. If the user asks about *recent* or *current* state, prefer \`git log\` or reading the code over recalling the snapshot.

## Available Operations

Use this tool to:
1. Save a new memory (specify type, name, description, content)
2. Search memories by query (optionally filter by type)
3. List recent memories (with pagination)
4. Get a specific memory by ID
5. Update an existing memory (by ID)
6. Delete a memory (by ID)
7. **temp_save / temp_read / temp_clear** — Temporary memory (临时记忆), session-scoped scratchpad, auto-cleared between sessions
8. **auto_rehearse** — Working memory (工作记忆) + Active memory (主动记忆), brings key memories + scratchpad to context end
9. **archive** — Long-term memory (长期记忆), compresses old memories into archive/ subdirectory
10. **evolve** — Nietzschean self-overcoming, marks old memory as overcome and creates successor
11. **rehearse** — Write selected memories to REHEARSAL.md for context end injection
12. **summarize** — Create recoverably compressed version of a memory
13. **genealogy** — Trace the evolution chain of a memory
14. **synthesize** — Aggregate related memories into structured domain knowledge article

Each memory is saved as a Markdown file with frontmatter containing name, description, and type.
The index file MEMORY.md contains a simple list of all memories for quick reference.
